A simple and easy to use habit tracking application for iOS, built with SwiftUI.

### Description
An easy-to-use tool called Habit Tracker was created to help you monitor your everyday routines. You can simply view all you need to do today, mark tasks as completed, and manage your habits thanks to the two primary displays "Today" and "Habits." You can alter the title, frequency, and days of the week for each habit on the "Habits" screen, and you can add new habits by clicking the "Add Habit" button. For simple tracking and identification, each habit has a specific color assigned to it. Additionally, you have the choice to give specific comments for poor scores because the app interfaces with Qualtrics SDK for collecting app satisfaction feedback. With Habit Tracker, creating wholesome habits won't take you long at all!
